# **Velvet Chains & Voidlight** THE GAME! kinda

## ⚙️ Core Setting Features

- **Consent Codices:** Every adventuring group uses “safe words” and a **Consent Codex**—a written
  agreement outlining boundaries for story elements and social encounters. A character can spend 1
  action to declare the safe word (“fiction”) to pause a scene and renegotiate terms.
- **Space‑Age Fantasy Meets Rimworld Survival:** PCs traverse rimworld colonies, neon skyports, and
  derelict space hulks. Interstellar travel exists via **Voidlight Drives**, but scarcity of parts
  and rival corsair crews create a frontier feel similar to a Firefly or Rimworld campaign.
- **Drama & Decadence as Resources:** Many new feats, spells and abilities draw power from “Drama
  Points”—a consumable resource replenished by engaging in theatrical roleplay, abiding by consent
  protocols, or performing acts of flair.

## 🌌 New Ancestries & Heritages

### **Corsair Human Heritage**

Humans raised among the Voidlight Armada are adaptive swashbucklers. They gain **Corsair Training**,
allowing them to choose one pirate weapon (cutlass, laser‑saber, harpoon launcher) and become
trained in it. At 1st level they can take the **Rope‑Swinger** ancestry feat, letting them traverse
vertical spaces with silken ropes as if they had a climbing speed.

### **Synth‑Courtesan Android**

Built to navigate both digital and social networks, these androids combine synthetic agility with
empathic subroutines. Their heritage grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy when negotiating
boundaries or consent. They can also project an empathic field once per hour, granting allies a +1
bonus on will saves against fear.

### **Rope‑Magi Tiefling**

Descended from outsiders tied to the plane of Shadow and Fetters, these tieflings have prehensile
tails reminiscent of silken cords. They gain the **Silkbind Tail** attack (1d4 bludgeoning, finesse)
and the **Whispering Knot** innate spell (once per day cast _message_, the message can travel along
any rope or chain regardless of distance).

## 🏴‍☠️ New Class Archetype: Voidlight Corsair

Any character can adopt the **Voidlight Corsair** archetype by taking the dedication feat at 2nd
level:

### **Voidlight Corsair Dedication (Archetype) Feat 2**

_Prerequisites:_ Trained in Acrobatics, access to a spaceship or sky‑sailing vessel. _Benefit:_ You
become an initiate in corsair combat and storytelling. You gain the **Corsair Strike** action (1
action): Make a melee or ranged Strike. If you move at least 10 feet toward your target first, add a
circumstance bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). _Special:_ You gain 2
Drama Points. You can spend a Drama Point to add a flourish to a successful strike, dealing an
additional 1d6 psychic damage as you taunt your foe with theatrical banter.

Additional archetype feats (taken at higher levels) include:

- **Dramatic Entrance (Feat 4):** Spend 1 Drama Point to arrive in an encounter by swinging on a
  rope, teleporting through a voidlight door, or stepping out of the shadows. You become hidden for
  1 round.
- **Rainbow Vomit Counterspell (Feat 6):** Once per day, when an enemy casts a spell, you can spend
  2 Drama Points to distract them with a rainbow light show. Attempt a performance check against the
  spell’s DC; on success, the spell is countered.
- **Consent Negotiator (Feat 8):** Gain expert proficiency in Diplomacy. When you attempt to Request
  something from a creature, if you mention a safe word and sincerely uphold boundaries, treat a
  failure as a success.

## 🎭 New Backgrounds

### **Rimworld Colonist**

You grew up on a hardscrabble frontier world. Choose two ability boosts (one must be Constitution or
Wisdom) and become trained in Survival and Athletics. You also gain the **Patch Hull** skill feat,
letting you repair starship hull breaches or fix vac‑suit tears quickly.

### **Consent Coordinator**

You served as the mediator for a skyport’s kink café or negotiation guild. Choose two ability boosts
(one must be Charisma or Intelligence). You’re trained in Diplomacy and Society. Once per day, when
two NPCs are in conflict, you can spend 10 minutes mediating; both parties become helpful toward you
if you succeed at a Diplomacy check.

### **Voidlight Engineer**

You worked on the heart of a Voidlight Drive. Choose two ability boosts (one must be Intelligence or
Dexterity). You are trained in Crafting and Arcana. You gain the **Jury‑Rig** feat: spend 1 action
to temporarily fix a malfunctioning electronic or magical device for 1 minute.

## 🪢 New Equipment & Consumables

- **Silken Harness (Level 3 Item):** This harness doubles as climbing gear and an art piece. As an
  interact action, you can secure yourself or a willing target, gaining a +2 item bonus to checks to
  resist being knocked prone. When used as part of a consent ritual, it grants each participant a
  Drama Point.
- **Consent Token (Consumable, Level 1):** A small carved coin inscribed with a safe word.
  Presenting this token during a social encounter grants a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10
  minutes.
- **Rainbow Grenade (Consumable, Level 5):** A thrown bomb that explodes in dazzling colors.
  Creatures in a 10‑foot burst must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be dazzled and take a –1 penalty
  to attacks for 1 round. Allies gain a Drama Point if they were not harmed by the blast.

## 🔮 New Spells & Rituals

### **Voidlight Bindings**

_Spell 3; Tradition:_ Occult; _Cast:_ [two actions] somatic, verbal. You conjure shimmering
restraints of consensual force. Choose one creature within 30 feet; it must attempt a Reflex save.
On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a critical failure, it is immobilized and flat‑footed.
You can dismiss the bindings as a free action. Affected allies gain 1 Drama Point upon release.

### **Rainbow Heatmap**

_Spell 1; Tradition:_ Arcane/Occult; _Cast:_ [three actions] material, somatic, verbal. You generate
a floating hologram depicting the target’s recent “commit history” — their actions in the last 24
hours. The GM provides a color‑coded map (hot spots where they were active). Allies gain a +1 status
bonus on checks to Track or Recall Knowledge about the target for 1 hour.

### **Sonic Consent Pulse (Cantrip)**

_Spell; Tradition:_ Primal; _Cast:_ [one action] verbal. You send out a resonant pulse that
reassures allies. All willing creatures within 15 feet gain a +1 status bonus to saves against
emotion effects until the start of your next turn. Using this spell during negotiations grants each
participant a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Diplomacy check.

### **Voidlight Rite (10th‑Level Ritual)**

_This complex ritual binds a crew together for an entire voyage._ Participants recite safe words,
share personal boundaries and commit to mutual respect. At completion, all participants gain the
**Corsair’s Bond** trait: once per day, as a reaction, they can grant an ally within 30 feet a
reroll on a failed skill check. Violating the bond (by ignoring boundaries) causes immediate loss of
all Drama Points and imposes a –2 status penalty to all Charisma‑based checks for a month.

## 📜 Optional Rule: Drama Points

Drama Points function similarly to hero points but are earned through roleplay:

- **Earning Drama Points:** When a player engages in particularly theatrical, consensual or
  over‑the‑top description of an action, or when they uphold boundaries in character, the GM awards
  a Drama Point (maximum 3).
- **Spending Drama Points:** Spend 1 Drama Point to reroll a failed check (as with a hero point) or
  to activate special features of Corsair feats, spells and items.
- **Redistributing Drama:** A player can give a Drama Point to another player if they have at least
  one and the table agrees this act fosters consent and camaraderie.

## 🪐 Using the Setting

To run adventures in **Velvet Chains & Voidlight**, sprinkle your campaign with:

- **Salvage Heists:** Boarding corporate freighters to liberate spice crates while ensuring everyone
  signed the piracy waiver.
- **Diplomatic Duels:** Negotiating safe‑word treaties between rival rimworld factions.
- **Neon Noir Mysteries:** Tracking a stolen consent codex through underbelly clubs and glittering
  orbital casinos.
- **Starship Battles with Flair:** Rescuing colonists from meteor storms while narrating
  micro‑novellas into the ship’s log.

Encourage players to lean into melodrama, creativity and affirmative consent. Remind them that in
this universe, **honoring boundaries is as heroic as slaying a dragon**, and that the true victory
lies in creating unforgettable, theatrical stories together.
