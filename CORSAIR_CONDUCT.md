# ‚öñÔ∏è Corsair Conduct Manifesto

*The Velvet Chains fleet operates under a code of consensual development, theatrical professionalism, and swashbuckling solidarity. This manifesto governs our shared voyage through the cosmos of collaborative code.*

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è **Our Sacred Oath**

We, the **Velvet Chains** crew, pledge to maintain a **consensual, inclusive, and theatrically delightful** community where all corsairs can contribute safely and authentically. Our development space celebrates:

- **Consensual Collaboration**: All interactions respect boundaries and prioritize enthusiastic participation

- **üé≠ Theatrical Professionalism**: Keep adult themes consensual, artistic, and appropriate for a collaborative technical space
- **üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Constructive Feedback**: Offer critiques that build up rather than tear down, with specific suggestions for improvement

- Acknowledge when you don't know something - learning together strengthens the fleet

- Share knowledge generously while respecting others' time and boundaries
- Use our theatrical aesthetic to make technical content more engaging, not to exclude or intimidate

### **In Community Interactions:**

- **Safe Word Protocol**: Respect when someone uses "fiction" to indicate they need space or a topic change
