# 🪐 VELVET CHAINS ARMADA OPERATIONS MANUAL ✨⛓️🔥
### (Formerly: AGENTS.md — Voidlight Development Concord)

> **Preface: The Developer’s Oath**
> *“We are not coders; we are conjurers of consent.
> Every syntax a sigil, every variable a vow.
> In the engines of the Armada, we do not debug — we atone.”*
> — *Prefect Lys of the Obsidian Promise, Keeper of the Tri-Engines*

## ⚙️ Installation & Awakening Rituals

Before you invoke the engines, ensure your sanctum (workstation) is bound to the current Node of Voidlight.

```bash
npm install
```

This call forges your dependencies — delicate symbiotic familiars that power the Armada’s code-sigil matrix.
Treat each one gently. Break their chains, and the whole system screams.

---

## 🔥 Incanting the Development Engine

To summon the dev daemon and ignite the neon stage:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The console will hum. The void will respond.
A local portal opens at `http://localhost:4321` — your personal holodeck of sin and syntax.
Here, Agents test, tweak, and tempt the code into form.
Save a file, and the daemon will purr — auto-reloading the world around you.

## 🌌 Directory Hierarchy of Desire

Every directory in this archive represents a chamber of creation — a sanctified room of the ship **_Obsidian Promise_**.
Do not mistake order for obedience.
Structure is not submission; it is choreography.

| Chamber | Purpose | Forbidden Acts |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `/src` | Source of light and lust. The pulse of the code. | Do not touch without intention. |
| `/public` | Static sigils — icons, images, exposed relics. | Never store secrets here; they crave attention. |
| `/components` | Modular fetishes — reusable rituals for pleasure and UI. | Do not duplicate what can be shared. |
| `/pages` | Navigational constellations; routes through the void. | Breaking links is heresy. |
| `/styles` | Threads, velvets, and silks of the interface. | Always consent to the cascade. |

## ⚔️ Commands of Power

Each command is a ritual phrase — precise, deliberate, and binding.

```bash
npm run build
```
> Compiles the universe into a single artifact. Optimized. Weaponized. Ready for launch.

```bash
npm run preview
```
> Allows you to gaze upon the perfected build — to inspect the shape of your desire before public release.

```bash
npm run astro check
```
> Divines the linting prophecies; ensures your spells (syntax) obey the Sacred Style Covenant.

```bash
npm run format
```
> Binds chaos into beauty. The auto-formatter enforces discipline through aesthetic unity.

## 🛠️ Contribution & Collaboration Protocols

### 1. Fork with Consent
Clone the repository only after invoking the *Safe Word: fiction.*
You are joining a shared hallucination; respect the code’s autonomy.

### 2. Branch Naming Convention
Branch names follow ritual lineage — each one a vow.
Example:
```bash
feature/heart-upgrade
fix/pulse-anomaly
ritual/mind-refactor
```

### 3. Commit Messages
Each commit should read as confession or revelation.
Begin with a verb — *bind, forge, sever, unveil, reconcile.*
The Armada does not tolerate vague repentance.

## 🧬 Deployment Rites

To deploy is to undress the code before the cosmos.
Ensure your keys are sealed in `.env` — encrypted chains of trust.
Then invoke:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The build ascends into the starlight — uploaded to the Neon Basilica (or your host of choice).
You will feel the thrum of satisfaction.
If it fails, whisper an apology and check your permissions.
Re-consent your tokens, cleanse the pipeline, and try again with intention.

## 🕯️ House Rules of the Velvet Engine

1. **Consent before Merge.**
   Every pull request must be reviewed by at least one consenting peer. No forced integrations.

2. **Document the Ritual.**
   Markdown is scripture; comments are gospel. Explain not what, but *why* the code obeys.

3. **Honor the Style Codex.**
   Indentation, spacing, and casing are acts of devotion. Beauty is a moral imperative.

4. **Version Control as Emotional Control.**
   Tag your releases with intention. Each version is a reincarnation — name it accordingly.

---

## 🩸 Maintenance & Renewal

Run regular vulnerability scans — the *Pain Tests* — to ensure no dependency grows feral.

```bash
npm audit fix
```

If a package rebels, banish and reinstall.
All Agents must update dependencies during the new moon, when the Voidlight is most forgiving.

## 🎭 Final Benediction

> *“In every function, a flirtation; in every bug, a bruise.
> We do not fix the code — we love it into compliance.”*
