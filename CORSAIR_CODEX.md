# 🏴‍☠️ BRIG BRIEFING: A CORSAIR'S GUIDE TO VELVET CHAINS MUTINY

*Welcome aboard, you magnificent scallywag! Ready to lash your code to our consensual space-pirate romance engine and make the galaxy quiver with theatrical git wizardry? These are the sacred rituals that will transform you from landlubber to legendary corsair of the voidlight fleet.*

## ⚓ **THE CAPTAIN'S SACRED OATHS**

Before you set foot on our pleasure-cruiser of code, swear these binding vows upon the altar of consensual chaos:

- **🌊 Consent Above All**: Our safe word is "fiction" - always respected, always honored, no exceptions
- **🎭 Theater Over Tedium**: We demand DRAMATIC FLAIR in everything - make your commits purr like satisfied krakens
- **🗡️ Velvet-Wrapped Steel**: Professional excellence disguised as decadent indulgence
- **🏴‍☠️ Found Family Forever**: Every corsair aboard this ship is precious cargo deserving silk-gloved treatment

## 🌟 **INITIATION RITUALS FOR NEW CREW**

### **⛓️ Claiming Your Quarters (Setup)**

```bash
# Board our pleasure vessel
git clone https://github.com/hsmalley/velvet-chains.git
cd velvet-chains

# Establish your personal dungeon (virtual environment)
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Enter the consensual coding trance

# Acquire the sacred formatting tools
pip install ruff  # Makes your linter blush with satisfaction

# Anoint the scripts with executable blessings
chmod +x voidlight_choreographer.py

# Forge the Rust weapons of mass seduction
rustup update && cargo --version
```

### **🪢 Learning the Rope Work (Code Style)**

#### **💎 Python Protocols (The Velvet Touch)**

Your Python must sparkle like stardust on silk sheets:

- **88 characters per line** - wide enough for proper dramatic flourish
- **Explicit imports** - no mysterious wildcards unless already present in our sacred texts
- **f-strings for interpolation** - because we demand expressive verbosity
- **Docstrings dripping with voidlight essence** - make functions sound like they belong in our kink dungeon

```bash
# Polish your Python until it gleams
ruff format voidlight_choreographer.py voidlight_whispers.py

# Make the linter moan with approval
ruff check voidlight_choreographer.py voidlight_whispers.py

# Ensure your bytecode compiles without choking
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=./.pycache python3.12 -m compileall voidlight_*.py
```

#### **⚔️ Rust Refinement (Forged Steel Beneath Velvet)**

Your Rust must cut clean while looking absolutely devastating:

- **Edition 2021** - we sail with the latest treasures
- **`cargo fmt` and `clippy` compliance** - no warnings tolerated aboard this vessel
- **`io::Error::other` over manual plumbing** - elegant error handling befits our aesthetic
- **Comments that whisper sweet technical secrets**

```bash
# Hammer your Rust into perfect form
cargo fmt --manifest-path voidlight_engine/Cargo.toml

# Submit to the clippy dominatrix
cargo clippy --manifest-path voidlight_engine/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Verify your creation doesn't explode on contact
cargo check --manifest-path voidlight_engine/Cargo.toml
```

### **🌈 Naming Ceremonies (Aesthetic Protocols)**

- **Files**: `voidlight_*` pattern for all new modules - mark them as ours
- **Functions**: Dramatic but descriptive (`summon_commit_storm`, `bind_silken_hooks`, `unleash_rainbow_chaos`)
- **Documentation**: Theatrical names that make HR blush (`CAPTAINS_LOG`, `CONSENT_DECREE`, `BRIG_BRIEFING`)
- **Comments**: Color, drama, and devastating wit - but keep the actual code production-ready

## 🧪 **THE PREVIEW PROTOCOLS (Testing Without Bloodshed)**

**NEVER** commit without preview - this is sacred law aboard our vessel:

```bash
# Always taste before swallowing (preview mode)
python3.12 voidlight_choreographer.py -n 10 --preview-only --svg-out preview_feast.svg

# Test the Rust engine without igniting the powder magazine
cargo test --manifest-path voidlight_engine/Cargo.toml --no-run

# Generate sample theatrical output for inspection
git-voidlight --seed 42
```

## 💋 **COMMIT MESSAGE SEDUCTION TECHNIQUES**

Your commit messages must seduce the git log like a corsair seduces admiralty:

```bash
# ✨ EXQUISITE EXAMPLES ✨
git commit -m "Bind voidlight hooks with fresh silken symlinks ⛓️"
git commit -m "Caress Rust engine errors with velvet-gloved handling 🖤"
git commit -m "Weave consent protocols into choreographer's preview ballet 💃"
git commit -m "Polish Python formatting until it gleams like moonlit steel ✨"

# 🚫 UTTERLY FORBIDDEN 🚫
git commit -m "fix bug"           # Boring! Lifeless! Unworthy!
git commit -m "update stuff"      # Makes the kraken weep with boredom
git commit -m "change things"     # Absolutely beneath our standards
```

## 🛡️ **CONSENT & SAFETY PROTOCOLS (Our Sacred Boundaries)**

### **🔒 The Golden Rules of Engagement**

- **Historical Fiction Warning**: Always flag when demo commands mutate git history
- **Consent-First Development**: Ask before major changes, respect "no" completely
- **Preview-Only Alternatives**: Offer safe harbor before unleashing commit storms
- **Safe Word Sanctity**: "fiction" means pause, breathe, recalibrate - always honored

### **⚖️ Ethical Corsair Standards**

- Keep adult themes **consensual and theatrical**, never crude or exploitative
- Use space-pirate and BDSM aesthetics **tastefully** - we're artists, not shock merchants
- Maintain **professional technical standards** beneath the velvet curtain
- Include **appropriate warnings** for any history-altering sorcery
