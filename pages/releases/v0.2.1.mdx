# ✨⛓️ Velvet Chains v0.2.1 — Patch Rite of the Obsidian Promise

> “Every version is a vow; every patch, a kiss of consent.” — Prefect Lys

A small but shimmering rite. This patch binds the recent restorations and rituals into a coherent
incantation, polishing edges while staying faithful to the Armada’s Style Codex.

## 💖 Highlights (Whispers from the Void)

- Re‑consecrated lock rituals and restored the Voidlight Engine artifacts.
- Polished the Next.js dev chamber with themed pages and global silks.
- Clarified release and lock workflows for smoother cosmic procession.

## 🔧 Changes (Choreography of Steel & Velvet)

- Pages awakened: `pages/_app.js`, `pages/_document.js`, `pages/index.js`.
- Global threads: `styles/globals.css` and a fresh `public/favicon.svg` sigil.
- Engine reliquary: `voidlight_engine/` (Rust) returns to the altar.
- Ritual scripts: `scripts/build_lore_json.py`, `scripts/validate_lore.py`.
- Workflows refined: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `voidlight-lock-ritual.yml`.

## ⚠️ Runes of Caution

- Requires Node ≥ 20 and Next 14.
- If your sanctum resists, cleanse: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.
